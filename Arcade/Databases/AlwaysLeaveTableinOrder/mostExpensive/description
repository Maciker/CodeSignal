The list of expenses is stored in a table Products which has the following columns:

id: unique product id;
name: the unique name of the product;
price: the price for one item;
quantity: the number of items bought.
The resulting table should contain one row with a single column: the product with the 
lexicographically smallest name on which Mr. Cash spent the largest amount of money.

The total amount of money spent on a product is calculated as price * quantity.
