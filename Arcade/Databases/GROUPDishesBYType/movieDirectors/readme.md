To find the directors whose movies you might want to consider watching in the first place, 
you've created a database of all the films you already own and stored them in a moviesInfo table, 
which has the following structure:

title: the title of the movie;
director: the director of this movie;
year: the year the movie was released;
oscars: the number of the Academy Awards this movie received.
Given the moviesInfo table, compose the list of directors you should consider watching more movies from. 
The resulting table should have a single director column and contain the names of film directors such that:

they shot movies after the year 2000;
the total number of Oscar awards these movies received is more than 2.
The table should be sorted by the directors' names in ascending order.
